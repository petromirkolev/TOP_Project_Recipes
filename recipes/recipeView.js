<h2>Pizza Burgers</h2>
<p>
  We are big fans of pizza burgers that some greasy spoons serve, but it is so
  hard to find a good one so I decided to come up with my own. Here is a real
  simple recipe that puts smiles on the faces of my family.
</p>

<h3>Ingridients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>4 slices mozzarella cheese</li>
  <li>4 fresh hamburger buns</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps to prepare</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Combine beef, tomato paste, salt, sugar, garlic powder, Italian seasoning,
    pepper, and oregano in a large bowl. Mix thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate
    to let flavors marry, about 4 hours.
  </li>
  <li>
    Form beef mixture into 8 thin patties. Place 1 slice of mozzarella cheese on
    each of 4 patties; leave at least a 1/2-inch border, breaking up the cheese
    as needed. Place remaining patties on top and pinch edges to seal in the
    cheese.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Fry burgers until browned and centers
    reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 6 to 7 minutes per side. Serve on buns.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Cook's note</h3>
<p>Use umami paste in place of tomato paste if possible.</p>
