<h2>Barbecue Turkey Meatballs</h2>
<p>
  VOSKOS® Nonfat Honey Greek Yogurt adds a hint of sweet to these lean meatballs
  dressed up with marmalade barbecue sauce. For easy shaping, use a small scoop
  to form the meatballs, then bake them off in the oven. To party with ease,
  transfer meatballs and sauce to a slow cooker set on warm or low heat setting
  to serve. Serve with crunchy pretzel sticks as a fun substitute for wooden
  picks.
